# Python Web Mappings
 
A simple interactive web map created using folium library in Python. The map locates the volcanoe and their elevation in US region.
It includes a layer control panel from which you can toggle the features. We have added two features in the map, namely  population and volcanoes.
The code uses 2 files - Volcanoes.txt and world.json. 
Volcanoes.txt holds the coordinates(latitude, longitude) of the volcanoes across US in CSV format, whereas 
world.json file has population data of the world.
