# Python Web Mappings
 
A simple interactive web map created using folium library in Python. 

The map locates the volcano and their elevation in US region.
The code uses 2 files - Volcanoes.txt and world.json. 
Volcanoes.txt holds the coordinates(latitude, longitude) of the volcanoes across US in CSV format, whereas 
world.json file has population data of the world.

It has two features in the map, namely  population and volcanoes. It also includes a layer control panel from which you can toggle the features.
